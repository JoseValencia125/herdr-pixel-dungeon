# Attribution and provenance

## Herdr Pixel Dungeon

All code and pixel art in this repository are original work, copyright (c) 2026 Nacho Valencia, released under the MIT license in LICENSE.

The room backgrounds (Resources/Sprites/rooms) and the heroes (Resources/Sprites/heroes, one per harness) were drawn for this project in Aseprite with the Endesga-32 palette. Their sources are in art/. Hero colours are inspired by each tool's branding; no logos are reproduced, and no affiliation is implied.

## Dependencies

The app is written in Rust and links MIT/Apache-2.0 crates (egui/eframe, tray-icon, notify-rust, rodio, rfd, auto-launch and their dependencies); `cargo tree` lists them. egui bundles the Ubuntu (UFL), Hack (MIT) and Noto Emoji (OFL) fonts.

## Inspiration

Inspired by [Claude Dungeon / claude-pixel-agent-web](https://github.com/thousandsky2024/claude-pixel-agent-web) by thousandsky2024, which first pictured coding agents as dungeon heroes. No code or artwork from that project is included.

## Herdr

[Herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr) provides the separately installed local runtime and CLI snapshot API. Herdr is not bundled. The standalone viewer's table of agent process names (`src/standalone.rs`) follows Herdr's `src/detect/mod.rs`, copyright the Herdr authors, Apache License 2.0. Vendor names only identify the agents Herdr reports.

Independent project; no affiliation with or endorsement by Herdr, Anthropic, OpenAI, Amazon, Google or thousandsky2024.
